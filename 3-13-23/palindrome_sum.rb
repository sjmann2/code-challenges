# A palindrome is any number, word, or phrase that reads the same forward as it does backward. 
# In this challenge, we are going to focus on palindromic numbers. For example, 12321 is a palindromic number, whereas 123 is not.

# Write a method/function that starts at 0 and finds the first twenty-five numbers where the number 
# plus its inverse equals a palindrome that is greater than 1,000.

# 47(number) + 74(inverse) = 121(palindrome) Note: This does not meet the greater than 1,000 rule.

# Collect the twenty-five numbers in an array as the return value. Be sure to collect the number and not the sum.

# Bonus: Once youâ€™ve found a working solution, see if you can create a solution without converting the numbers to strings/arrays.

# rules:
# n + n.reverse > 1000
# first 25 numbers starting from 0
# return the 25 numbers as an array

# until loop with an empty array defined
# if number to string + number to string reversed is greater than 1000 add to array
# break out of loop once the array equals 25
